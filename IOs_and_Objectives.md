## Abstract
   Made at the request of Fira.

  Intelligence Officers(IOs) are a role intended to provide marines with a unique playstyle, different from what is usually expected of squad roles. 
IOs are tasked with scouring the colony in search of documents and simillar items to receive "tech points", 
which can then be cashed in for goodies to help the other marines.

  Additionally other tasks, such as setting up comms or power and retrieving corpses will also award tech points, encouraging marines to pursue other tasks
such as setting power or utilising the fulton for retrieving corpses.
## Goals
- Provide marines with a unique playstyle different from the usual unga
- Encourage marines to disperse across the map rather than conglomerate on a deathball
- Encourage inter-department cooperation (IOs-Marines, Marines-PO, IO-PO)

## Non-goals
- Bring IOs to the forefront of marine strategy. IOs should be a nice boon, not mandatory.
- Encourage cadehugging. Hiding behind cades while IOs try to earn more points shouldn't be a viable strategy.
- Give IOs OP to gear/skills. IOs shouldn't be desirable to people because of their skills/equipment.

## Content
  IOs will function simmilarly to how they did in the past, with their main goal being to roam the colony in search of intel.
The main difference from how they functioned in the past will be the much MUCH lower impact of them on a given round, rather than
game ending nukes IOs will only be able to acquire extra req/CAS points or OBs for their team. The aim is to make IOs not completely uselesses
but to also not have them be mandatory like in the old days of DEFCON.

## Alternatives
  Doing away with the concept of IOs and simply dissemenating their tools to the general marine population,
this may encourage command to assign squads to specific taks other than "scout" like retrieve intel, set power or collect corpses.

  Additionally, making IOs a squad role, this will either result in command merging all squad IOs into a single squad, thus invalidating the squad part entirely,
IOs running off either alone or in a mini squad, also invalidates the point of making it a squad role, 
IOs stay in their squad and do a subpar job due to not being able to go to all areas of the map.

  Also, if the objective angle is found to be undesirable making documents the only way of earning "tech points" is also an option.
## Potential Changes
- "IOs earn points too slowly"
	- Increase the reward for completing tasks.
- "There's no incentive to hold engineering after setting power"
	- Make it so power and communications award a constant stream of points rather than being one and done.
- "No one wants to process intel"
	- Create a role simillar to DCC but for IOs, possibly an SO of sorts to help with coordination.
