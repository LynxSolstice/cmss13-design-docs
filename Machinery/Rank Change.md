## Abstract

<!-- An abstract is a short blurb, about a paragraph or two, succinctly describing your feature. This should mostly be "why", but can include "what". -->

Add an additional tab to the identification computer (/obj/structure/machinery/computer/card) to allow for modification of ranks. This will be useful for RP and demotions as well as the reacquistion of the correct rank when a marine loses their ID.

## Goals

1. Add a tab to the ID computer "rank".
2. Have options to edit the rank of the ID to any rank *below* that of the logged in user.
3. Have a CO override that allows for a handprint identification to reacquire a Major/LtCol rank on an ID.

## Non-goals

1. This SHOULD NOT be used flagrantly and for no reason. I have thought about how to implement it best to avoid misuse and would definitely like to hear other's thoughts on it.

## Content

Pretty simple, addition of a "rank" section on the ID computer that has all of the USCM ranks to choose from but only available to modify an ID card's rank to something below the rank of the logged in user.

Design-wise here are the current tabs:

My proposition would look like (epic paint I know, I'm a coder):

## Alternatives

If adding a machine that could potentially increase the rank of an ID becomes an issue it may be easier to just have a demotion machine in the brig.

## Potential Changes

Not sure yet but I'd happily take suggestions on things that *could* go wrong.
