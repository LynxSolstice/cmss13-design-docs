## Abstract

<!-- An abstract is a short blurb, about a paragraph or two, succinctly describing your feature. This should mostly be "why", but can include "what". -->

Add an additional tab to the identification computer (/obj/structure/machinery/computer/card) to allow for modification of ranks. This will be useful for RP and demotions as well as the reacquistion of the correct rank when a marine loses their ID.

## Goals

1. Add a tab to the ID computer "rank".
2. Only available for logged in users of rank O2 and up.
3. Have options to edit the rank of the ID to E1-E7 and O1-O2.
4. Have a CO override that allows for a handprint identification to reacquire a Major/LtCol rank on an ID and ranks outside E1-E7 and O1-O2.
5. Have a button to print rank boards and pins.

## Non-goals

1. This SHOULD NOT be used flagrantly and for no reason.
2. This SHOULD NOT be a headache for staff.

## Content

Pretty simple, addition of a "rank" section on the ID computer but only available to modify an ID card's rank if the logged in user is O2 and above (so heads and up) and unless CO Overrided the only ranks available are E1-E7 and O1-O2.

Secondarily new rank pins and boards will be required and can be printed here.

Design-wise here are the current tabs:

My proposition would look like (epic paint I know, I'm a coder):

## Alternatives

If adding a machine that could potentially increase the rank of an ID becomes an issue it may be easier to just have a demotion machine in the brig.

## Potential Changes

Not sure yet but I'd happily take suggestions on things that *could* go wrong.
