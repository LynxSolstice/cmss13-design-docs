## Abstract

Research is currently suffering due to lack of care about it ever since the introduction of Techwebs/Removal of DEFCON. Currently it is functional at a minimum and with the lack of features, it rarely ever changes the round flow. First act of rejuvenation is including new features that researchers can do and provide more co-operation between OT and the marines.

## Goals

1. To provide multiple methods of assisting the USCM be it with buffs, debuffs, unique mechanics etc.

2. To make said methods have each of their own difficulty on making them.

3. To make said methods be able to be used in combinations together.

4. To encourage co-operation between other departments and the marines.

## Non-goals

1. Significantly affect balance over a certain time period. This design does not aim to change the balance of the round in a quick manner, said methods will always take time to create, giving the antagonists time to not worry about it.

2. Make the USCM dependant on it. Research is intended to be a side project just like OT and is going to treated as a side mini goal for the USCM.

3. Make said features easily available. Due to their power factor, these features/methods should have a certain rarity to them to avoid them affecting the rounds too much.

## Content

The features added would be, a new way that makes chemicals work by applying it differently via TOUCH (through spraying and gas) and making said chemicals now also work on xenomorphs (depending if the property can do it). New additional properties that also contain the new features of TOUCH application. Refactoring code of chemicals to use the new mechanics of properties (example, Epinephrine's unique intravenous feature has now been replaced by a new property that does the same thing but now it can be added to other chemicals with the help of the new property) Tweak the cost of properties based on the new features to make them less/more available (Stimulant property costs increased while underused properties such as organ healing ones decreased) Tweak chemical generation to make CL 1/2 chemicals have more unique properties. Refactor code by replacing it with flags and defines. Buying clearence levels now slightly increasing passive income. Disabling redundant/impossible to find chemicals generating in recipes. Decrease the cost of buying chemical papers. Numerous fixes.

## Alternatives

1. Completely remake Research and everything related to it from scratch (Including Hydroponics). This would require a hefty ammount of time to do and should be considered very carefully and not rush it like it has been rushed before with Techwebs.

## Potential Changes

1. Tweak the properties to be less/more powerful

2. Tweak spray bottle code to provide more chemicals per "injection"

3. Provide some way for xenos to slow down Research indirectly

4. Include more ways to obtain CL 3+ chemicals
