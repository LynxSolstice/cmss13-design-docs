## Abstract

Charger crusher is the modern CM variation of the premoba crusher of old. It is intended be base crusher replacement with a simple premise: Charge
<!-- An abstract is a short blurb, about a paragraph or two, succinctly describing your feature. This should mostly be "why", but can include "what". -->

## Goals

1. Charger should be a tanky caste that fills in the role of base.
    We intend to fully replace base as both have similar purposes and can cause one to be used over the other. Base's abilities could be used in a future ccrusher strain

2. Charger should be fun to play
    Premoba crusher is commonly reguarded as being more fun than current base. Whether that is just boomer nostalgia or not, we shall try our best to emulate it.
    *CROOSH CROOSH CROOSH! NOTHING STOPS THIS TRAIN!*
    *"There is nothing more fun than knocking ungas over like bowling pins!"*

3. Charger should be good at sieging
    Just like the premoba crusher, charger should also be good at sieging. 
<!-- This is a numbered list clearly detailing your goals for the feature. As per usual, this should be a mixture of both why and what. -->

## Non-goals

1. Become too powerful
    We don't want charger to become too powerful and destroy balance while accpeting balance will be upset as entire base caste will be changed.

<!-- Just like goals, but the opposite! Every feature has boundaries it won't step over. These should be written as if they start with "We will not...". -->

## Content

The reason why this replaces base crusher is simple: conflicting purpose. Both castes accomplish similar tasks, just with different ways to achieve them. Base is actually more powerful than charger due to better AoE abilities and not needing any distance to charge. Furthermore, doing this allows more design freedom as we can use some of the same abilities as base or base it off from them without needing to make it fill a differant role than base.

Charger is also meant to be very plasma hungry as was the premoba crusher as to give marines a rest, make it reliant on weeds and elevate the skill ceiling as you need to have enough plasma to charge and pop off escape abilities. We're aiming for around 3 full charges with escape abilities being used before plasma is drained.

Other than that the basis of crusher is simple: Hold a movement key in any direction, and you will charge. As you charge, you gain momentum until it is full, in which you then deal full damage to humans,cades,etc

Charger shall also have Directional armor as passive to make it much more tankier when coming in, but vunerable both during an attack and during retreat. This is good because it makes the caste situationally tanky while still being counterable to marines.In addition it is a good balance number to change shall crusher be too squishy/tanky. Moonwalking is disabled as it invalidates the downsides of this. ( Yes I know the dirlock nerf came in, it still does invalidate it, however a test could be done with it on if nessesary)

The other active abilities shall support the primary abilities as mainly being escape and AoE abilities. Most of the ideas are tentative with only tumble being implemented. One ability that is the perfect example of this and is likely going to stay is Tumble.

Tumble is a simple escape ability that "rolls" the charger to the side a couple tiles. Cooldown should be adjusted so that it should be avalible if you pop it off on a *full* charge for every *full* charge. Unfortunately this ability does not provide much room for balance changes as any movement more than 3 tiles would make it look very stupid and be too powerful.

<!-- Now's where you get into clear detail about everything your feature does. **You should still be explaining 'why' things are that way, *as* you describe what.** Be as detailed as possible. -->

## Alternatives

- Keep charger a strain, keep base as-is
    Doing this will potentially have a role conflict which will result in Base being used much more due to superior AoE and more tacitical charging as charger will be left to the wayside. 
<!-- Provide potential alternatives to your feature, either ones that align with your design values, or ones that don't that you suspect will be suggested. If you are including the latter, make sure to explain why you didn't choose that. -->

## Potential Changes

- "Charger is too tanky/squishy"
    Modify directional armor/ base armor amounts until desire balance is achieved. Modifying directional armor will allow it to be more tanky on the attack while modifying base armor amount will make it more tankier and harder to kill in general in addition to directional armor.

- "Charger is too powerful/weak in damaging humans/cades/walls/sentries/etc"
    Modify damage multipliers that are neatly listed in the Charger.dm file

- "Charger is too easy to counter"
    Create another escape oriented/AoE ability and/or increase base armor slightly.

- "Charger is too hard to counter"
    Nerf escape abilities.

<!-- Most of the time you're not going to get the best design first try. It helps to try your best to predict what *could* go wrong, and suggest alternatives that can be taken, without sacrificing your design. -->
